\section{Conclusion}

This work constructed an almost-square-root ORAM scheme 
in which a Feistel Cipher was used for the permuation
and in which a sorting trick was using to significantly
reduce the cost of PRF evaluations in the shuffle step.

An implementation was produced which was more efficient than the 
linear ORAM base-line for roughly $n > 4000$ elements.
