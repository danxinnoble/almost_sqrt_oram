\section{Implementation}

The MPC-ORAM protocol described above was implemented in 
SCALE-MAMBA \footnote{https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/SCALE-MAMBA}, 
a secure multiparty framework based on the SPDZ protocol 
\cite{damgaard2012multiparty}
and a series of continued developments \cite{damgaard2013practical,
keller2018overdrive, aly2019zaphod}.
This framework allows for secure computation with any number of parties
and is secure against malicious adversaries.
While most of the system is secure in the full-threshold case,
this requires a key generation setup which has not yet been 
included in the release (though has been implemented \cite{rotaruactively}). 
As such, we used the honest majority security setting.

The protocol was implemented essentially as described in the design.
One limitation is that recursion is challenging to implement in
SCALE-MAMBA. Therefore, random shuffling was performed using
a Bene\v{s} permutation network \cite{benevs1964permutation}  
which requires $n \log_2(n) - \frac{n}{2}$ gates
rather than the slightly improved Waksman network
\cite{waksman1968permutation} 
which requires $n \log_2(n) - n + 1$ gates.
